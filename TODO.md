# Awesome Todo

A bunch of things I'd like to see improved, in no particular order.

* More decoupling:
 * The buffered line-parser really should be a separate module.
 * Adding new commands requires a bit of annoying boilerplate. Make that easier.
* A node.js based test-suite.
* Refactor list operations into store.js
* Create output like Redis does
* Dump to file
* Simplify arg fetching in Command
* Match Redis big-O guarantees
